# Patient Facts

The completeness-focused checks in the Patient Facts module assess the
availability of patient clinical data. The number of clinical events per
year of follow-up for each patient in a cohort is computed and
stratified by visit type in order to help investigators evaluate
utilization patterns across the cohort.
