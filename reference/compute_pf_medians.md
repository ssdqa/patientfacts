# Compute median fact counts by visit & domain and by site, visit, & domain

Compute median fact counts by visit & domain and by site, visit, &
domain

## Usage

``` r
compute_pf_medians(data_input, site_col, agegrp = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- data_input:

  input table generated by `loop_through_visits` and reduced with
  `combine_study_facts`

- site_col:

  the column in the data that holds site names

- agegrp:

  If you would like to stratify the results by age group, create a table
  or CSV file with the following columns and include it as the `agegrp`
  function parameter:

  - `min_age`: the minimum age for the group (i.e. 10)

  - `max_age`: the maximum age for the group (i.e. 20)

  - `group`: a string label for the group (i.e. "10-20", "Young Adult",
    etc.)

## Value

dataframe that contains the total median number of facts for that visit
& domain as well as the median number of facts for the site, visit, &
domain for each study. The medians are compute both with patients who do
not have evidence of the domain (with 0s) and without those patients
(without 0s)
