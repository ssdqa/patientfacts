# Compute distance from mean to identify patients with an anomalous number of facts per year of follow up

Compute distance from mean to identify patients with an anomalous number
of facts per year of follow up

## Usage

``` r
compute_dist_mean_pf(data_input, site_col, n_sd = 2, agegrp = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- data_input:

  input table generated by `loop_through_visits` and reduced with
  `combine_study_facts`

- site_col:

  the column in the data that holds site names

- n_sd:

  the number of standard deviations that should be used as a threshold
  to identify an outlier

- agegrp:

  If you would like to stratify the results by age group, create a table
  or CSV file with the following columns and include it as the `agegrp`
  function parameter:

  - `min_age`: the minimum age for the group (i.e. 10)

  - `max_age`: the maximum age for the group (i.e. 20)

  - `group`: a string label for the group (i.e. "10-20", "Young Adult",
    etc.)

## Value

a dataframe that summarises the number of patients with fact counts that
fall +/- `n_sd` away from the mean both at visit_type + domain and site,
visit_type, + domain levels

        contains columns: person_id, start_date, end_date, fu, site, domain, var_val, var_ever, study,
                          visit_type, n_fact, zscore_fact, outlier_fact, prop_outlier_fact, n_site_fact,
                          zscore_site_fact, outlier_site_fact, prop_outlier_site_fact
